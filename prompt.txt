I will give you an editorial about student protest from the 1960s. Can you help me identify the following:
- What were students protesting about?
- Did the protestors use violence (e.g. fight, arson, shooting)
- What were the responses from the police, schools, or local authorities?
- Did the police, schools, or local authorities use violence against protestors? 
- What is the stance or opinions on this protest in the editorial?
- Which sentence in the editorial best summarizes the editorial's stance or opinions?
- Are they sympathetic with students (or side with students) or not?
